Description

Bukaba is a clean, minimal and responsive theme, it a one page scroll website which is well suited for portfolio or other information websites. If a static home page is selected it will append any pages created to the home page with an associated section ID. The primary navigation will link to the section on the home page. It has a fully customisable header, footer and navigation bar. A secondary, social media menu can be added into the footer which automatically pulls the required social media icon from 'font-awesome'. Many theme options are available via the Wordpress Customizer such as colours, header image, logo image and footer text. The theme is translation and multilingual ready.


You can install the theme by unzipping it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

Afterwards you can continue theme setup and customization via WordPress Dashboard - Appearance - Theme Options. For detailed theme documentation.
